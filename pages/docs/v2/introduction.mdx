ZEIT Now is a cloud platform for **static sites** and **serverless functions**. It enables developers to host websites and web services that **deploy instantly**, **scale automatically**, and requires **no supervision**, all with **no configuration**.

Getting started with Now takes just a few steps and lets you get up and running with your new project in less than a minute.

## Install Now CLI

To deploy with ZEIT Now, you will need to install [Now CLI](/download), a frequently updated, and [open-source](https://github.com/zeit/now), command-line interface.

You can get Now CLI from either npm or Yarn. Using npm, run the following command from your terminal:

<Snippet
  dark
  text="npm i -g now"
/>

To verify that you have installed Now CLI, try running `now help` from your terminal.

With Now CLI installed, you can now login using the following command:

<Snippet
  dark
  text="now login"
/>

## Creating a Project and Deploying

You can create a new Next.js application with the following command using either npm or Yarn:

<Snippet
  dark
  text="npm init next-app my-next-project"
/>

When your Next.js app is created, all you have to do is move into the directory (with `cd my-next-project` in your terminal) and then deploy your app with a single command in your terminal:

<Snippet
  dark
  text="now"
/>

Once deployed, you will get a unique URL to reference the current version of your project, and a staging alias that is assigned on each deployment to share the latest changes under the same address.

These URLs look like the following:

- Unique Deployment URL: <https://my-next-project-6bnjtkazh.now.sh/>
- Staging Alias: <https://my-next-project.now-examples.now.sh/>
