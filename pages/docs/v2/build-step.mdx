When you make a deployment with ZEIT Now, the first step is the build step. Now recognizes a custom `build` script, with that build script outputting your app into the `public` directory.

Now also supports optimized frameworks that only need to be created and then they are ready to deploy with [Now CLI](/download) from the terminal.

You are also able to use [environment variables](#using-environment-variables-and-secrets) (including secrets) in your builds if you do not want to hardcode values for the build.

## Optimized Frameworks

A variety of frameworks have been optimized for ZEIT Now. The following list contains those frameworks that have been optimized and what has been done to aid their performance only on Now. Any getting started method will immediately be ready to deploy with [Now CLI's `now` command](/download) from the terminal, or to be deployed with a [Git integration](/docs/v2/git-integration):

| Framework        | Get Started Command                               | Optimized                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |

## Defining a Build Script

To build your project, Now looks for a `build` script inside of a `package.json` file. By providing a build script, Now will build your project from fresh on every deployment.

For example, to build Next.js fresh, each time you deploy, the following `build` script should be placed in the `package.json`:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build"
  }
}
```

<Caption>

  <InlineCode>build</InlineCode> script that builds Next.js on each deploy.

## Using Environment Variables and Secrets

When building your project, it may be necessary to use [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable).

Adding environment variables requires two steps, defining the environment variable, then making it available to your projects' build step.

<Note>
  This section covers how to make environment variables available at{' '}
  <b>Build Time</b>, if you would like to make them available during{' '}
  <b>Run Time</b>, please see the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/serverless-functions/env-and-secrets/">
    Serverless Functions documentation
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

### Adding Secrets

To define an environment variable, you should use **Now Secrets**. By using **Now Secrets**, the data will be encrypted and stored securely, no longer directly accessible by anyone, and only exposed to deployments as environment variables.

Adding **Now Secrets** can be done with [Now CLI](/download), providing three options to work with them.

<Note>
  When adding Now Secrets with Now CLI, the secret name is automatically
  lowercased before being stored.
</Note>

To **define a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets add <secret-name> <secret-value>"/>

To **remove a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets rm <secret-name>"/>
<Caption>Removing a <b>Now Secret</b> using <GenericLink href="/now">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

To **rename a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets rename <secret-name> <new-name>"/>
<Caption>Renaming a <b>Now Secret</b> using <GenericLink href="/now">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

### Providing Environment Variables

To provide your project with environment variables during the build script, you should create a `now.json` file like the one below:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "VARIABLE_NAME": "@secret-name"
    }
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that provides an
  application's build step with a defined environment variable.

To use the environment variable from inside the application you would need to reference it using the correct syntax for the language being used. For example, using Node.js, the syntax would be:

```
process.env.VARIABLE_NAME
```

<Caption>
  Accessing a defined environment variable from within a Node.js application.
</Caption>

Now, whenever the `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` key is used, it will provide the application's build step with the value declared by the referenced **Now Secret**.

### Reserved Variables

The ZEIT Now platform reserves the usage of some environment variable names by default. You can find a list of these names in the [configuration documentation](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration/#reserved-variables).

## Ignored Files and Folders

By default, ZEIT Now ignores certain files and folders for security and performance reasons, preventing them from being uploaded during the deployment process.

```bash
.hg
.git
.gitmodules
.svn
.cache
.next
.now
.npmignore
.dockerignore
.gitignore
.*.swp
.DS_Store
.wafpicke-*
.lock-wscript
.env
.env.build
.venv
npm-debug.log
config.gypi
node_modules
__pycache__/
venv/
CVS
```

<Note hint>
  You do not need to add any of the above files and folders to your{' '}
  <InlineCode>.nowignore</InlineCode> file.
