Redirecting is useful for a variety of situations, including redirecting a visitor that goes to your domain with `www.` prefixing the URL to [your domain](/docs/v2/custom-domains) without that prefix.

Now provides configuration to help make redirecting easier through [the `routes` property](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#routes) within a [`now.json` file](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration).

To redirect visitors from the `www.` subdomain to your naked domain, you can create a `now.json` file with the aforementioned configuration property in a new folder to deploy as a separate deployment to the one that is [aliased](/docs/v2/custom-domains#deploying-with-your-domain) to your naked domain.

## Step 1: Project Setup

First, create a directory for this project to live in. For example, using a Unix terminal, create the directory `redirect` and [`cd`](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)>) into it:

<Snippet dark text="mkdir redirect && cd redirect" />

Next, create a `now.json` file in that directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "alias": ["www.your-domain.com"],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "status": 301,
      "headers": { "Location": "https://your-domain.com/$1" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Breakdown

The above configuration uses a few properties to configure the deployment:

- `version`: The [version property](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#version) specifies the Now platform version to use, in this case, we are using the [latest version 2.0](/docs/v2/platform/overview/#versioning).
- `alias`: The [alias property](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#alias) defines a single or set of aliases to assign the deployment to, using [the production aliasing environment](/docs/v2/custom-domains#deploying-with-your-domain).
- `routes`: The [routes property](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#routes) allows Now to route your deployment as you intend it and configure it to be routed using a source and destination, or by way of a source, status, and headers.

With this configuration, you are allowing Now to understand how to route the visitor with the `routes` property from the source, comprising of a PCRE regex capture group `/(.*)`, a [HTTP status of 301](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301) (Moved Permanently), and a `Location` header that directs to the naked domain with the captured path appended via `$1`.

## Step 2: Deploying

With the configuration complete and ready, you are ready to deploy.

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

Using Now CLI, you can deploy the project from your terminal using the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

To push your deployment into production, deploy and alias it with the [production aliasing target](/docs/v2/custom-domains#deploying-with-your-domain):

<Snippet dark text="now --prod" />

Now, when visiting either the production alias (www.your-domain.com), a [staging alias](/docs/v2/custom-domains#deploying-with-your-domain), or a [deployment URL](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/urls/), the visitor will get redirected to the location set as defined by the [`routes` property](/docs/v2/deployments/routes/) in the `now.json` file.
