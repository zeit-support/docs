[Pusher Channels](https://pusher.com/channels) is a service that makes it easy to add real-time data and functionality to web and mobile apps by using [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).

This guide demonstrates how to get started creating and deploying real-time apps with [Channels](https://pusher.com/channels) and [ZEIT Now](/now).

<Note>
  This guide is an overview. For the full code, see the linked example at the
  bottom of this page.
</Note>

## Step 1: Pusher Account Setup

Start by making an account on [Pusher](https://dashboard.pusher.com/accounts/sign_up) and creating a new app by clicking the **Create new app** button.

Next, give your app a name and select a region. Choose a region closest to the majority of your customers to minimize latency.

From your dashboard, find and click on the Channels app you just created.

  height={1800 / 3}
  oversize

/>
<Caption>Selecting the app from the Channels dashboard.</Caption>

Next, click the **App Keys** tab. Copy these values so that you can save them as [Now Secrets](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/env-and-secrets/#adding-secrets) and then provide them to your app as [environment variables](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/env-and-secrets/#providing-environment-variables).

## Step 2: Set Up Your Project

With your [Pusher Channels](https://pusher.com/channels) account and app set up, the next step is to create your project to deploy, with only a root directory for static files, and an `/api` directory for Serverless Functions.

<Snippet dark text="mkdir -p pusher-channels/api && cd pusher-channels" />
<Caption>Creating and entering into a <InlineCode>/pusher-channels</InlineCode> directory that contains an <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> folder.</Caption>

Create an `index.html` file in your project with the code below.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="https://js.pusher.com/5.0/pusher.min.js"></script>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

<Caption>
  Adding <InlineCode>script</InlineCode> tags inside the{' '}
  <InlineCode>body</InlineCode> of your <InlineCode>index.html</InlineCode>{' '}
  file.
</Caption>

Create an instance of a [Pusher Channels client](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/using_channels/client-api-overview) that subscribes and reacts to events on the appropriate channel. Additionally, send data to your Serverless Function that will trigger a [push event](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/using_channels/events).

Create a `main.js` file where you will initialize a Channels object with your `app-key`, subscribe to the appropriate channel and bind a callback function to react to events within that channel.

```js
// Initialize Channels client
let channels = new Pusher('app-key', {
  cluster: 'cluster-region'
})

// Subscribe to the appropriate channel
let channel = channels.subscribe('channel-name')

// Bind a callback function to an event within the subscribed channel
channel.bind('event-name', function(data) {
  // Do what you wish with the data from the event
})
```

<Caption>
  Initializing a <InlineCode>Channels</InlineCode> client, subscribing to a
  channel, and binding to an event.
</Caption>

All that's remaining on the client is to create a way to send data to your Serverless Function to trigger push events. To achieve this, add the snippet below to your `main.js` file.

```js
async function pushData(data) {
  const res = await fetch('/api/channels-event', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  })
  if (!res.ok) {
    console.error('failed to push data')
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  A function in <InlineCode>main.js</InlineCode> to send event data to our{' '}
  <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> endpoint.
</Caption>

Using [Now CLI](/download), add the following [Now Secrets](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/build-step#using-environment-variables-and-secrets) to your account and expose them as environment variables.

<Snippet dark text={`now secrets add channels-app-id [Your Channel's app ID]`} />
<Caption>
  Adding the <InlineCode>channels-app-id</InlineCode> as a Now Secret.
</Caption>

<Snippet dark text={`now secrets add channels-app-secret [Your Channel's app Secret]`} />
<Caption>
  Adding the <InlineCode>channels-app-secret</InlineCode> as a Now Secret.
</Caption>

<Note hint>
  Since the <InlineCode>app-key</InlineCode> and{' '}
  <InlineCode>cluster</InlineCode> are already exposed on the client and are not
  sensitive, you <b>do not need</b> to add them as secrets.
</Note>

Next, create a minimal `now.json` file to expose your secrets as environment variables, replacing `app-key` and `cluster-region` with the values provided by Channels.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "env": {
    "APP_ID": "@channels-app-id",
    "KEY": "app-key",
    "SECRET": "@channels-ap-secret",
    "CLUSTER": "cluster-region"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that provides the app with
  environment variables.
</Caption>

Add the dependencies for the Serverless Function from inside the `/api` directory.

<Snippet dark text="cd api && npm init -y && npm i pusher" />
<Caption>Entering the <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory, initializing the <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file and installing the <InlineCode>pusher</InlineCode> dependency.</Caption>

Create a `channels-event.js` file inside the `/api` directory that initializes a new Channels object and receives data from the [`req.body` helper method](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/supported-languages/#node.js-request-and-response-objects), before invoking [`channels.trigger`](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-node#publishing-events) to register the event.

```js
const Channels = require('pusher')

const {
  APP_ID: appId,
  KEY: key,
  SECRET: secret,
  CLUSTER: cluster
} = process.env

const channels = new Channels({
  appId,
  key,
  secret,
  cluster
})

module.exports = (req, res) => {
  const data = req.body
  channels.trigger('event-channel', 'event-name', data)
  res.status(200).end('sent event successfully')
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>channels-event.js</InlineCode> file inside the{' '}
  <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory.
</Caption>

When `channels.trigger` is called, an event will be broadcast to all subscribed clients.

## Step 3: Deploying with ZEIT Now

With your [Channels](https://pusher.com/channels) app set up, it is ready to be deployed with [ZEIT Now](/docs).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by installing [Now CLI](/download). You are now ready to deploy your app with **a single command**.

<Snippet dark text="now" />
<Caption>Deploying your project with the <InlineCode>now</InlineCode> command.</Caption>

If you want to deploy your Channels project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/github) or [Now for GitLab](/gitlab) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and aliased on push to master.

You can find a full code example of an app made with this guide in [the ZEIT Now examples repository](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/vanilla-pusher-functions) on GitHub, along with the [live example](https://pusher-whiteboard.now-examples.now.sh/) deployed with ZEIT Now.
